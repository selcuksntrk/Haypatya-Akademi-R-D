# Haypatya-Akademi-R(esearch)-D(evelopment)

Haypatya Academy project aims to be a non-profit education platform. The Haypatya-R-D github repo we are in has been created to include the research and development notes of this project. As the architect and developer of this project, my first goal is to conduct extensive research and create the most efficient education methodology possible. So I guess the research and methodology part of this project will take longer than the development part. In addition, I aim to share the notes I have taken about the research I have done with their resources here. Thus, you will have the chance to see which scientific resources I used while creating the education methodology as the project progresses with me. When I thought about creating this project, I didn't set a specific time limit for the research and development part, because I thought I couldn't set an accurate time limit, as there were other things I was busy with in my own life. But you will be able to follow my entire development process with me from this repo.


My only wish, which can not be given in schools:

-critical thinking

-learning to learn

-when a problem is encountered, approaching to solution with the right method

-being a social and aware individual

-being able to do research

-being able to access to information

-being able to do analysis

to bring such talents to people, to prepare them for the 21st century, to provide equal opportunity in education. I hope we can see the final version of this project together. I am very excited to start this project, I hope it will benefit to humanity.
